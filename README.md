During the past few weeks, we have played with several learning analytics tools, including visualization tools such as Gephi and R Studio. These tools helped us answer the question of “what” the data looks like, and this week we will dive into a new area - Visual Analytics (VA), to think about “why” the data looks like this. Through readings and activities, we will get familiar with the concept of VA and reveal its power to understand your data. VA has been used in many fields, such as business analytics, health care, journalism and education. It requires human involvement and has created the communication between the user and the data.
